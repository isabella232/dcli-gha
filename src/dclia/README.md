# dclia

Command line tool for retrieving current Destiny 2 activity status for players.

Information includes current activity, location, and in the case of PvP modes (Crucible and Gambit), current map.

The API updates pretty quickly, and can be used to see check the activity and / or map while you are loading in.

The too expects that the manifest has been downloaded and synced to the default location using [dclim](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/tree/main/src/dclim). You can specify a custom path to the manifest using the --data-dir argument.

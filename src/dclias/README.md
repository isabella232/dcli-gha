# dclias

Command line tool for downloading and syncing Destiny 2 Crucible activity history.

On initial run, the tool will download all Crucible activity history and data for the specified character, and store it in a [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database file. On subseqent runs, it will download any new activities since the last sync.

This provides a local sqlite3 database that contains all crucible matches and individual stats for the specified player. It can be used with other dcli apps, or you can make custom queries against the database.

The app has support for storing data across multiple players and characters.

The app syncs in 3 stages:

1. First, check if there are any local unsynced activities from previous syncs. If so, download their details (step 3).
2. Call the Destiny API, and get a list of all new activities since the last sync. If it is the first time the app has been synced, then retrieve all Crucible activity ids for all time for the specified character. Store the activity ids.
3. Loop through all of the activity ids that have been found, and download all of the data on each activity and store it in the database.

If an error occurs when downloading the list of activities (step 2), then the app will abort. Just rerun.

If any errors occur while downloading activity details (step 3), then that specific activity will be skipped, and saved to retry the next time there is a sync.

Depending on the number of activities, the initial sync can take a couple of minutes. Subsequent synces should be much faster.

The tool stores match data for the specified character. It does not store match results for the other players in the match.

## Compiling

This utility is written and compiled in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

When compiling you must have an environment variable named `DESTINY_API_KEY` which contains your [Bungie API key](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application).

To compile, switch to the `src/` directory and run:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

which will place the compiled tools in *src/target/release*

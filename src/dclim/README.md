# dclim

Command line tool for retrieving and managing the Destiny 2 manifest database.

When running the utility will check whether a more current version of the Destiny 2 API manifest database is avaliable (comparing it to the last version which has been downloaded). If a new version is found, it will download the database, uncompress it, and save it to the directory specified when calling the utility. It will also save a file containting metadata about the current version, which is used for future checks for updates.

Manifest is stored in the system specific local app data directory with the file name:
manifest.sqlite3, along with meta-data with information about the downloaded
version. This is used to to determine whether the remote version has been updated.

The utility expects that the downloaded manifest will not be moved from the directory it is downloaded to, and uses that information to determine whether a new version is avaliable. If the manifest is moved, the utility will re-download the manifest on next check.

The utility uses the download url for the manifest to check for a new version. While it displays the version number, that is not used to detect whether a new version is avaliable.

The manifest is a [Sqlite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.

## Compiling

This utility is written and compiled in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

When compiling you must have an environment variable named `DESTINY_API_KEY` which contains your [Bungie API key](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application).

To compile, switch to the `src/` directory and run:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

which will place the compiled tools in *src/target/release*

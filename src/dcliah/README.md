# dcliah

Command line tool for viewing Destiny 2 Crucible activity history and stats.

The application will display individual game results and stats, aggregate game results and stats, as well as individual weapon stats. You can specify specific crucible game modes, as well as time periods to create custom reports. Private and non-private stats are seperated from each other.

dcliah pulls its data from the local Destiny 2 activity database store. By default, dcliah will create and update this file with the latest activity data, but it can also be seperately managed using [dclias](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/tree/main/src/dclias).

The first time the database downloads activity data may take a couple of minutes (depending on bandwidth and number of activities). However, subsequent syncs should be very quick.

It supports storing and tracking stats for multiple players and characters.

If you want to sync the database seperately via dclias, you can pass the `-no-sync` flag to dcliah and it will not update the activity store.

The tool expects that the manifest has been downloaded and synced using [dclim](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/tree/main/src/dclim).

member-id and platform can be retrieved with [dclis](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/tree/main/src/dclis).   
   
Manifest can be downloaded and synced with from [dclim](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/tree/main/src/dclim).

Activity data store can be created and synced seperately using [dclias](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/tree/main/src/dclias).

**NOTE** : Currently, due to a [bug](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api/issues/1386) in the Destiny 2 API, you will only get results for private matches when specifying *all_private*. The other options are still included in case the bug is fixed. If viewing private match stats is important to you, please leave a comment [here](https://github.com/mikechambers/dcli/issues/10).

## Compiling

This utility is written and compiled in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

When compiling you must have an environment variable named `DESTINY_API_KEY` which contains your [Bungie API key](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application).

To compile, switch to the `src/` directory and run:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

which will place the compiled tools in *src/target/release*
